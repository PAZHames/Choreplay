## Hi there! 👋

We are HTCPCP. That’s the error 🫖 ‘I am a teapot’ 🫖. And with a name like that, you already know we love silly solutions to boring problems. So we sat down together and asked ourselves, what is something boring that we can make delightful? Our lineup includes:

**Phoebe:** Development + Problem Solver Pro

**Rebecca:** Development + Caffeine Addiction Pro

**Karina:** Product + pushing boundaries with questions like ‘how many packets of crisps can I stress eat in 3 hours?’ 

**Grace:** Product + Logo Design + gnome syndrome 

Our project goal is simple: to take a group moment where we can replace frowns with smiles!

 

## So, what’s the problem? 🤔

A truth universally acknowledged: far too many parts of adult life are boring. And repetitive. 

Debating with your partner about what to have for dinner?

Whose turn is it to do the dishes in your flatshare?

Kids are arguing again about who does which chore? 

Every day, we are confronted with boring chores, dull choices and conversations we don’t want to have. Jobs we know that we need to do, but really don’t want to. A chat with our partners, kids or flatmates about whose turn it is to take out the trash that becomes debates about who is doing what. It’s the most boring group task there is, but what can we do to avoid it?

How can we turn this moment into something fun and, maybe even, a little bit silly?

### Introducing: ChorePlay. What don’t you want to do?

Invite your family, friends or flatmates to a mini-game that assigns your chores and choices for you. It’s as easy as:

🧹 **Pick your chore:** House cleaning, what’s for dinner or who’s paying the bill. Want to gamble with other choices?Choose a custom task that you can design from scratch

🛠 **Customise tasks:** Pick, choose and personalise your selection

👥 **Invite family or friends:** Send out a quick invite link for everyone to join 

🎲 **Play the game:** Select your game, play, and let the game decide your fate! 

**The end result: a dopamine hit and decision made for you.** Because it’s more fun to challenge someone to space invaders than discuss who is cleaning windows this week.

## Accomplishments

We’re green and keen, so our team have had a steep learning curve for this Hackathon!

- “We learnt how to use, and now sort of hate, Figma!” - Grace

- Working together efficiently and collaboratively (with a low mortality rate) 

- “My mum described our app as ‘something she wished she had when I was younger to stop me arguing so much’” - Karina

## What does the future look like for ChorePlay?

Right now, ChorePlay is limited to a single moment in time - one conversation about chores. Your custom selection isn’t saved for future use. Our vision for the future: create a profile that you can use to re-use previous selections and save custom options.

Why? Because we want users to feel like the experience is truly personalised, and truly simple. 

## How can we make ChorePlay sustainable?

Ads: old but gold. We are going to monetise ChorePlay by having ads
